D&D Character Creator
=========

This is the D&D Character Creator. Its main goal is to offer an easy way for anybody who wants to try out D&D to quickly create a character. I originally wrote this in C++/Qt and this is a port to C#/.NET.

## Important Note
At this time the Character Creator can not be executed. This is due to the fact that the database for private use and testing contains copyrighted information from the official D&D Player's Handbook. I am currently in the process of reworking it for the publicly available [SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd).
